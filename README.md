InternetTest Pro - Your Windows connection toolkit. Monitor, diagnose, and optimize internet connectivity with ease. Empowering users with actionable insights, from network diagnostics to WiFi password recovery. Seamlessly enhance your online experience anytime, anywhere.

✨ **New:** Introducing [InternetTest CLI](https://github.com/Leo-Corporation/InternetTestCLI), a command line interface that provides the same features of InternetTest Pro.

## Features

InternetTest Pro is a powerful and modern connection utility designed for Windows users. With its comprehensive set of features, InternetTest Pro empowers you to monitor and optimize your internet connection experience. Here are some of the key features:

### Check Internet Connection

Easily determine whether your Windows device is currently connected to the internet. InternetTest Pro provides a quick and accurate way to assess your online status.

### Perform Speed Test

Measure your internet connection's speed with precision using the built-in speed test feature. Understand your download speed to ensure you're getting the performance you expect from your service provider.

### Website Availability Check

Verify the availability of websites in real-time. InternetTest Pro allows you to check whether specific websites are up or down, helping you identify potential network or website issues.

### DNS Information Retrieval

Retrieve DNS information for a domain using the DNS lookup feature. Similar to the `dig` command, InternetTest Pro provides detailed DNS records for domains, enabling you to diagnose and troubleshoot network-related problems.

### Nearby WiFi Network Information

Discover nearby WiFi networks and gather essential information about them. InternetTest Pro provides insights into available networks, aiding in the selection of the most suitable and stable connection.

### IP Address Display

The "IP Address Display" feature in InternetTest Pro provides you with an immediate and straightforward way to access your device's current IP address. Your device's IP address is a fundamental identifier used to communicate on a network.

### IP and URL Geolocation

      alt="A screenshot of the 'Locate IP' page of InternetTest Pro"
    />
</picture>
The "IP and URL Geolocation" feature in InternetTest Pro enhances your understanding of network routing and the physical locations of servers or websites. This functionality allows you to:

- **Geographical Context:** Discover the approximate physical location of an IP address or URL. This information provides geographical context, which is essential for understanding where network resources are located in the world.

- **Network Diagnostics:** Geolocation data can be crucial for diagnosing issues related to content delivery or latency. If you're experiencing slow loading times for a website, knowing the server's location can help identify if distance plays a role.

- **Security Awareness:** Geolocation can also offer insights into potential security threats. If you detect unexpected or suspicious IP addresses from certain locations, it could indicate unauthorized access attempts or compromised resources.

### Ping Functionality

    <img
      src=".github/images/screens/4.png"
      alt="A screenshot of the 'Ping' page of InternetTest Pro"
    />
</picture>
Conduct ping tests to measure the latency and responsiveness of IPs or URLs. InternetTest Pro's ping feature helps you evaluate network performance and identify potential bottlenecks.

### IP Configuration Details

      src=".github/images/screens/5.png"
      alt="A screenshot of the 'Trace Route' page of InternetTest Pro"
    />
</picture>
InternetTest Pro includes a traceroute feature that enables you to trace the path your data takes through the network from your device to a target IP address or URL. This feature helps you understand the network routing and identify potential points of congestion or delays. With InternetTest Pro's traceroute functionality, you can:

- **Trace Network Hops:** Obtain a detailed list of intermediate routers or hops that your data traverses on its way to the destination.
- **View IP Addresses:** For each hop, InternetTest Pro displays the corresponding IP address, allowing you to analyze the routing path and identify any unexpected detours.

- **Evaluate Latency:** Measure the round-trip time (latency) for each hop, helping you identify potential bottlenecks or areas of network congestion.

- **Identify Network Issues:** Detect issues such as packet loss or excessively long latency at specific hops, aiding in troubleshooting connectivity problems.

The traceroute functionality in InternetTest Pro provides valuable insights into the network's structure and performance, enabling you to optimize your network connections and diagnose issues effectively.

### WiFi Password Recovery

      src=".github/images/screens/3.png"
      alt="A screenshot of the 'Recover WiFi Passwords' page of InternetTest Pro"
    />
</picture>
The "WiFi Password Recovery" feature in InternetTest Pro offers a convenient and secure way to retrieve stored WiFi passwords for networks that your device has previously connected to. This capability can be incredibly useful in various scenarios:

- **Forgotten Passwords:** If you've forgotten the password for a WiFi network you previously connected to, InternetTest Pro can help you recover it. This is especially handy if you have numerous devices connected and can't easily access the password.

- **New Devices:** When you're setting up a new device, having the ability to retrieve previously saved WiFi passwords ensures a smooth setup process; you can retrieve your passwords from your old computer.

- **Sharing Networks:** If you want to share a network's password with a friend or family member, this feature allows you to easily retrieve the password without the need to access the router's settings.

InternetTest Pro brings together a comprehensive suite of tools to empower Windows users with detailed insights into their internet connection and network environment. Whether you're troubleshooting connectivity issues or optimizing your online experience, InternetTest Pro has you covered.
